## **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing App with Apache Beam and MinIO**  

## **Introduction**  
This application is designed to handle **data ingestion** and **preprocessing** tasks in a **scalable and distributed** manner using **Apache Beam** and **MinIO**. It processes raw sales data, applies transformations, and stores the results in a **MinIO bucket**.  

The app leverages **Apache Beamâ€™s SparkRunner** to support distributed processing within a **Kubernetes cluster (Minikube)**, making it suitable for **multi-cloud deployments**.

## **Key Highlights**  

### **Apache Beam Integration:**  
- **Distributed and Scalable Transformations:** Built with **Apache Beam** for parallel and scalable data processing.  
- **Flexible Runners:** Supports **FlinkRunner** and **SparkRunner** for cloud and local environments.  

### **Preprocessing Pipeline:**
- **Validation Checks:** Ensures data integrity by handling missing values, duplicates, and malformed data.
- **Transformations:**
  - Generates domain-specific features like purchase frequency, refund flags, and recent purchase indicators.
  - Computes derived metrics for customer behavior analysis, enabling churn prediction models.
- **Aggregation and Feature Engineering:**
Adds features like frequency of purchases, refund rates, and activity recency to capture behavioral patterns for churn modeling.

### **Kubernetes-Ready:**  
- **Dockerized Application:** Easily deployable as a **Docker container**.  
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets:** Supports dynamic configurations for cloud environments.  
- **Liveness and Readiness Probes:** Ensures fault tolerance during deployment.
